# This is a custom file used to keep track of the files
# that should be tested and (more importantly) their
# dependencies in order of dependency.

# This file is sadly necessary because xsim is dumb and
# parses files in the provided order. Meaning that a file
# must be read before its dependencies or xsim will crash.
